<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>

1 cup yogurt

1 tablespoon lemon juice

4 teaspoons ground cumin, divided

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

2 teaspoons cayenne pepper

2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger

2 teaspoons salt, divided, or more to taste

3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces

4 long skewers

1 tablespoon butter

1 clove garlic, minced

1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped

2 teaspoons paprika

1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

1 cup heavy cream

¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

</ul>

<ol>
    Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.

    Stir in chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
    
    Preheat a grill for high heat.
    
    Lightly oil the grill grate. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade.
    
    Grill until juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side.
    
    Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Sauté garlic and jalapeño for 1 minute. Season with remaining 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.
    
    Add grilled chicken, and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and garnish with fresh cilantro.
    
    Serve over rice.

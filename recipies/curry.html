<ul>

1 cup yogurt <br>

1 tablespoon lemon juice <br>

4 teaspoons ground cumin, divided <br>

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>

2 teaspoons cayenne  <br>

2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper <br>

1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger <br>

2 teaspoons salt, divided, or more to taste <br>

3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces <br>

4 long skewers <br>

1 tablespoon butter <br>

1 clove garlic, minced <br>

1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped <br>

2 teaspoons paprika <br>

1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce <br>

1 cup heavy cream <br>

¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro <br>

</ul>

<ol>
    Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 2 teaspoons cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. <br>

    Stir in chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. <br>
    
    Preheat a grill for high heat. <br>
    
    Lightly oil the grill grate. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade. <br>
    
    Grill until juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side. <br>
    
    Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Sauté garlic and jalapeño for 1 minute. Season with remaining 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.  <br>
    
    Add grilled chicken, and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and garnish with fresh cilantro. <br>
    
    Serve over rice. <br>
